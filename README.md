## Description
### The challenge
- Implementing a shopping cart by using class components of React.
- The purpose of this app is to display a list of products, and when the user selects the product to order, the app displays the product price, delivery price (free shipping if it is $2,000 or more), taxes, and total price.

## My process
### Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- Material-Ui
- JavaScript
- React
- NPM 
  - **gh-pages**  https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages

### Useful resources
- [**ReactJS Tutorial - 6 - Class Components**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnV34uLEzis&list=RDCMUC80PWRj_ZU8Zu0HSMNVwKWw&start_radio=1&rv=lnV34uLEzis&t=1)
- [**Functional Components VS Class Components in React**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZCQRHNmjJ8)
- [**React class vs function style** (Language: Korean)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuHgQVnccGMCEfBwnNGsJCQDiqSWI-edj)

### Things I applied
- JavaScript Array Methods: filter, find, map, reduce
- React  
  - CLASS components
  - Props and Events: Passing data between components
  - Conditional Rendering of Components
  - State

### What I learned
- In **the shopping cart version 01 project**, I used **function components**, whereas, **in version 02**, I implemented a shopping cart using **class components**. throughout this implement, I learned the difference between the Class component and the Function component in react.
